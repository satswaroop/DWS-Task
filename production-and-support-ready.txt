Recommended Improvements Before Production Release


Enhanced Validation and Error Handling:
Implement more detailed validation for request parameters to ensure they meet all necessary constraints (e.g., valid UUID format for account IDs).
Provide more informative error messages and comprehensive error handling to cover all potential edge cases.


Security Enhancements:
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can perform transfers.
Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
Add input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.


Logging and Monitoring:
Integrate logging for all significant events and errors for better traceability.
Set up monitoring and alerting for key metrics (e.g., number of transactions, failed transactions).


Performance Optimization:
Conduct performance testing to identify bottlenecks and optimize the application's performance under load.
Implement caching strategies where appropriate to reduce database load.


Scalability:
Design the system to be scalable to handle increasing loads, including database scaling and horizontal scaling of application servers.


Database Management:
Implement database migration tools for seamless schema changes.


Comprehensive Testing:
Expand test coverage to include integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests.
Automate testing as part of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.


Documentation:
Provide thorough documentation for API endpoints, including usage examples and response formats.
Document the overall system architecture and setup instructions for developers and operators.
